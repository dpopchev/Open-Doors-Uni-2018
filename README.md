# Open-Doors-Uni-2018

The presentation I made at Open Doors of Sofia University, Physics Department. The original title was "Scalar tensor theories - the new true theory of gravity?", but more suitable would be "Brief history of our understanding of Gravity"

## Getting Started

You should not have any trouble with running the project. In "Papers" there are the papers used, in "images" are the images for the presentation, ins "src" is the source python code for the simulations, "Notes" are my notes on the presentation.

The simulations consist in solving ODE equation for free falling bodies (zero initial velocity) for different models

- Aristotelian mechanics - presumes the velocity is proportional to the mass
- Galilean mechanics - the rate of change of velocity is proportional to constant
- Newtonian mechanics - the rate of change of velocity is proportional to forces actin on the body, in this particular case it presumes there is air resistance proportional to velocity

The simulations clearly show that light bodies fall the same hight approximately the same time, but for heavier ones the time may change - thus the primitive idea of Aristotle.

- Newtonian orbit - calculates the orbit in Newtonian gravity, and shows the existence of anomaly - oscillating perihelion of orbits.
- GR orbit - calculates the orbit predicted in General relativity, it clearly shows that despite Newtonian orbit should be closed, when general relativity effects take place, it becomes open - and thus the explanation of Mercury perihelion anomaly
